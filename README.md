## The Journey of making CoinSwitch Android App

Hello there, I am Nalini kanta Ojha an Aspiring Android Developer learning at Masai School. You might have used the coinswitch Android App, which is Indiaâ€™s an online platform that enables customers to Buy and Sell Crypto Currency .

Moving ahead, we team Elite developed a clone of the App of CoinSwitch in just 5 days as a part of our curriculum. This blog is all about our journey and the challenges we faced while building the project.

The Team Members are:
1. Vijay Kumar
2. Nalinikanta Ojha
3. Nimit Agarwal


**A little about the teammates and their contributions.**
I canâ€™t thank Avadhut and Nalinikanth enough, who worked hard for this project to become what it is today. I think the best way to thank them would be to mention their contribution and let their work speak for them.

Nimit Agarwal was responsible for designing the Home Fragment layout. These works improve app functionalities.

Vijay Kumar was responsible for designing the Account Fragment and Rewards Fragment layout. These works improve app functionalities.

In the meantime, I handled the Market Fragment, API calls, Room Database, Watchlist Fragment, Currency Buy And Sell section, and Search Fragment integrating the blog with our app, I used to merge all our codes at night and was tracking our progress of us all.

Though this project was not a piece of cake. I loved to work with these amazing guys during this 5 days journey we got lots of learnings and got a broader perspective about the application lifecycle.
